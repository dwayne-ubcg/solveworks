# SolveWorks Discovery Call Template

**For:** Brody | **Purpose:** Get real data for credible proposals | **Duration:** 20-30 min

---

> ⚠️ **THE #1 RULE: Never guess numbers. If they don't know, write "unknown" and move on.**
> A past proposal had savings projections higher than the client's actual expenses. That kills trust instantly. Every number in our proposals must come directly from this call.

---

## Before the Call

You already have their AI Audit quiz answers (15 questions). **Review them.** Reference specific answers during the call — it shows you paid attention and skips redundant questions.

**Mindset:** This is two small business owners having a conversation, not a sales pitch. You're figuring out IF and HOW we can help. Some people won't be a fit. That's fine.

---

## 1. OPENER (2 min)

*Goal: Set the tone. Casual, human, not salesy.*

> "Hey [Name], thanks for booking this. I checked out your audit answers — really interesting stuff. Before I jump in, mind giving me the quick version of what [Business Name] does?"

**Then ask:**

- **How long have you been running this?**
- **How many people on your team?** *(including part-time, contractors, VAs)*
- **Roughly what revenue range are you in?** *(Don't push if they dodge — note it and move on)*

💡 *Why this matters: Team size and revenue tell us if $450/mo is realistic for them and how complex their operations are.*

**NOTES:**
| | |
|---|---|
| Business | |
| Industry | |
| Years running | |
| Team size | |
| Revenue range | |

---

## 2. CURRENT TECH STACK & COSTS (5-8 min) 🎯

*Goal: This is THE money question. Build the "you're already spending this" case.*

> "Let me ask you something most people have never actually added up — what software and tools are you paying for every month to run your business?"

**Walk through each category. Write down the tool AND the monthly cost:**

| Category | Tool | Monthly Cost |
|----------|------|-------------|
| CRM / contacts | | $ |
| Email marketing | | $ |
| Scheduling / booking | | $ |
| Social media tools | | $ |
| Invoicing / payments | | $ |
| Project management | | $ |
| Website / hosting | | $ |
| Chat / messaging | | $ |
| Analytics / reporting | | $ |
| AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) | | $ |
| Other: __________ | | $ |
| Other: __________ | | $ |
| **TOTAL** | | **$_______** |

**How to ask naturally:**

- *"Do you use anything for managing contacts or leads? Like a CRM or even just spreadsheets?"*
- *"What about email — Mailchimp, Constant Contact, anything like that?"*
- *"How do people book with you — is there a scheduling tool?"*
- *"Any project management stuff? Trello, Asana, Monday?"*
- If they say "I don't know the exact cost" → *"Ballpark is fine — $20 range? $50?"*
- If they truly don't know → write "unknown" — **do NOT estimate for them**

💡 *Why this matters: If they're spending $300-500/mo on disconnected tools they still manually operate, our $450/mo isn't a new expense — it's a consolidation. This reframes the entire conversation. If they spend almost nothing on tools, they're probably not our client.*

**🔑 KEY NUMBER → Total current monthly tool spend: $________**

## 3. PAIN POINTS — IN THEIR WORDS (5 min)

*Goal: Hear what actually frustrates them. Don't lead them.*

> "What's the thing that eats up the most of your time that you wish you didn't have to do?"

**Follow-ups:**

- **"Walk me through what happens when a new lead comes in."** *(How fast do they respond? What falls through cracks?)*
- **"What's the most annoying part of your week — the stuff you dread doing?"**
- **"Have you ever lost a customer or a deal because something slipped?"**
- **"If you could hand off one thing tomorrow and never think about it again, what would it be?"**

**Write their exact words** — we'll use them in the proposal.

💡 *Why this matters: People buy to fix pain they already feel, not theoretical improvements. Their words go directly into the proposal so they see themselves in it.*

**NOTES (use their language):**

| Pain point | Their words |
|------------|------------|
| Biggest time waste | |
| What frustrates them most | |
| What falls through cracks | |
| Thing they'd hand off first | |

---

## 4. ACTUAL NUMBERS (5 min)

*Goal: Get real data points. No guessing. If they don't know, write "unknown."*

> "I want to make sure anything we put together for you is based on real numbers, not guesses. So let me ask a few specifics..."

- **How many leads/inquiries do you get per month?** ________
- **How many of those turn into customers?** ________
- **What's your average response time to a new lead?** ________
- **How many hours/week do you spend on admin tasks?** ________ *(scheduling, email, data entry, follow-ups)*
- **How many hours/week on social media / marketing?** ________
- **Do you have any idea how many leads go unanswered?** ________
- **What does one new customer typically worth to you?** ________ *(lifetime or annual — either works)*

**If they say "I don't know":**
> "Totally fair — that's actually really common. Let's skip it and we won't guess either."

💡 *Why this matters: These numbers go directly into ROI calculations in the proposal. Bad numbers = bad proposal = lost credibility. "Unknown" is infinitely better than a made-up number.*

---

## 5. CURRENT PROCESSES — A DAY IN THEIR LIFE (3-5 min)

*Goal: Understand how work actually gets done today.*

> "Take me through a typical Monday morning. You sit down — what do you do first?"

**Listen for:**

- [ ] Manual data entry between systems
- [ ] Copy-pasting between tools
- [ ] Forgetting to follow up
- [ ] Things that depend on one person remembering
- [ ] Stuff written on paper or sticky notes
- [ ] "We used to do that but stopped"
- [ ] Tasks that could be automated but aren't

**NOTES:**

```
Morning routine:


Lead handling process:


Customer follow-up process:


Recurring weekly tasks:


```

💡 *Why this matters: This tells us exactly what the AI agent needs to do. It's the blueprint for the build.*

---

## 6. DECISION INFO (2 min)

*Goal: Know who decides, when, and what could block it.*

- **"Besides you, is anyone else involved in making this kind of decision?"** ________
- **"Is there a timeline you're working with — anything driving urgency?"** ________
- **"Have you looked at other solutions, or is this the first conversation?"** ________
- **"Any concerns or hesitations I should know about upfront?"** ________

💡 *Why this matters: Avoids the "let me check with my partner" black hole. If there's a co-decision-maker, we may need to loop them in.*

---

## 7. CLOSE THE CALL

> "This is really helpful. Here's what happens next — I'm going to take everything you told me and build out a custom proposal. It'll show exactly what your AI agent would do, what it replaces, and how the numbers work based on what you just shared. No made-up savings, no inflated projections — just what's real. I'll have that to you by [date]. Sound good?"

**Set the follow-up:**
- [ ] Proposal delivery date: ________
- [ ] Follow-up call booked? Y / N — Date: ________
- [ ] Anyone else to include? ________

## 🚩 RED FLAGS — Signs This Isn't a Fit

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| Spends almost nothing on tools ($0-50/mo) | Hard to frame as consolidation. $450/mo feels like a big new expense. |
| "I don't really use technology" | Adoption risk is high. They may not use what we build. |
| Team of 1 with very low revenue | Might not have budget. Tread carefully. |
| Wants a silver bullet, not a tool | Expects AI to magically fix a broken business model. |
| Can't articulate any pain points | If nothing hurts, nothing gets bought. |
| Pushes hard on price before understanding value | Price shoppers rarely stick. |
| Won't share any numbers at all | We can't build a credible proposal without data. |

**If you spot 2+ red flags:** Still be helpful, finish the call professionally, but flag it internally before we invest time on a proposal.

*Remember: A honest "this might not be the right fit" builds more trust than a forced sale. The right clients sell themselves once they see the numbers.*
