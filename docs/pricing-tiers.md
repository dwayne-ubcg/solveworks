## Competitive Positioning

SolveWorks is **not** a chatbot or SaaS subscription. It's a **managed, dedicated AI agent** running on hardware the client can see and touch. Key differentiators:

- **Dedicated hardware** — not shared infrastructure
- **Always on** — runs 24/7, not session-based
- **Persistent memory** — learns and remembers over time
- **Fully managed** — client never touches config or code
- **Secure by design** — sandboxed, encrypted, monitored
- **Human-managed** — real people (Brody & Dwayne) handle maintenance, not a ticketing system

*Pricing is subject to final review. All figures in USD.*


> ⚠️ **OUTDATED** — Confirmed pricing is $250/mo + $1,500 setup (see memory/2026-02-19.md). This tiered doc was a draft that was never approved. Do not use.
