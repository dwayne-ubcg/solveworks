# Brody Prep — Rylem Discovery Call

## Who You're Talking To
- **Mike** — miked@rylem.com
- **Company:** Rylem Staffing (rylem.com) — Seattle-based staffing agency
- **What they do:** Place marketing, finance, HR, tech, and admin professionals
- **AI Audit Score:** 61/100, estimated 15 hrs/week savings

## What Mike Already Told Us
He responded to our proposal and said: **"What I'd like to focus on is how we get more sales meetings with clients for our BDMs."**

This is his #1 priority. Everything on the call should center on this.

## What BDMs (Business Development Managers) Do at Staffing Agencies
- Research companies that might need staffing help
- Cold outreach (email, calls, LinkedIn)
- Follow up with prospects multiple times
- Book meetings with decision makers (HR directors, hiring managers)
- Prep for those meetings
- Log everything in the CRM

Most of this is repetitive, manual, and time-consuming. An AI agent can handle a LOT of it.

## What We Can Build for Rylem (Talk Points)
1. **Lead Research** — Agent scans job boards, LinkedIn, company news for hiring signals (companies posting lots of jobs = they need staffing help)
2. **Personalized Outreach** — Auto-generate cold emails based on the prospect's open roles, industry, and pain points
3. **Follow-Up Sequences** — Automated, personalized follow-ups at the right intervals — never drop a lead
4. **Meeting Booking** — Qualify inbound leads and book directly into BDM calendars
5. **Pre-Meeting Briefs** — Before every meeting, agent delivers a summary: company overview, their hiring needs, recent news, talking points
6. **CRM Automation** — Auto-log every touchpoint so BDMs sell instead of doing data entry

## Questions to Ask Mike

### Understanding the Problem
- How many BDMs do you have?
- What does their typical day look like? How much time prospecting vs. in meetings?
- How are they finding new leads right now? (LinkedIn, job boards, referrals, cold calls?)
- How many outreach touches before a meeting books? (emails, calls, follow-ups)
- What's the meeting-to-close ratio? (helps us understand value of each meeting)
- What CRM do they use?

### Understanding the Value
- How many meetings per BDM per week right now?
- What's the target? Where do they want to be?
- What's an average deal worth when they place someone? (helps us show ROI without making up numbers)
- If each BDM booked 2 more meetings per week, what would that mean for the business?

### Current Tools & Spend (THE KEY QUESTION)
- What tools/subscriptions are you paying for right now? (CRM, email tools, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, Apollo, etc.)
- Rough monthly spend on sales tools?
- This is how we frame our price as consolidation, not new cost

### Technical / Practical
- What email system? (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Any existing automation? (email sequences, CRM workflows)
- How do they handle scheduling? (Calendly, manual, etc.)

## Red Flags to Watch For
- If they want a "guaranteed number of meetings" — we can't promise that, only that the agent does the work
- If they have zero budget for tools already — might not be the right fit
- If the BDMs are resistant to any tech — adoption matters

## How to Position It
"Your BDMs are spending hours on research, outreach, and follow-up that an AI agent can do in minutes. We build an agent that handles the prospecting pipeline — finding leads, personalizing outreach, following up, and booking meetings — so your BDMs walk into more meetings with better prep, every week."

## After the Call

- Number of BDMs
- Current tools and monthly spend
- How they find leads now
- Meeting targets

Mika will generate the final proposal from your notes. No guessing, no made-up numbers.
