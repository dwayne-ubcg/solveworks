# SolveWorks X/Twitter Posts — Draft

## Post 1
We built AI agents for our own businesses first.

Ran them for months. Broke things. Fixed things. Learned what actually matters.

Then we productized it.

That's the difference between us and every "AI agency" that popped up last year.

## Post 2
A sales founder told us our Kanban pipeline board is "the best CRM in the business."

It's not a CRM.

It's a custom AI agent that happens to manage his entire pipeline better than any off-the-shelf tool he's tried.

That's what building for workflows instead of features looks like.

Hot take: Most businesses don't need a chatbot.

They need an employee that works 24/7, never forgets a task, and costs less than a part-time hire.

That's what we deploy. $250/mo. Dedicated hardware in your office. Your data never leaves your building.

Just shipped: expense tracking that replaced a client's entire Google Sheet system.

Partners snap a photo of a receipt on their phone. Done.

No data entry. No end-of-month scramble. No "who forgot to log this."

3 weeks from request to live.

"Within the first day, it had live lead scanners running, dividend research with analyst targets, and call coaching from my recordings. If you're an entrepreneur wearing multiple hats, this is the closest thing I've found to a real chief of staff."

— Drew Millington

We didn't prompt him to say that. We just built what he needed.

Cloud AI: your data sits on someone else's server, trains someone else's model, and you hope their privacy policy holds up.

Local AI: a dedicated Mac Mini in your office. Your data never leaves your building. Our cybersecurity team runs nightly audits.

Same intelligence. Completely different trust model.

Built an entire back office for a wine distribution company in 3 weeks.

From another country.

Pipeline management. Expense tracking. Meeting summaries. Task coordination.

The old way: hire 2-3 people, train for months, hope they stick around.

The new way: one agent, deployed and running before the month is out.

What our Mission Control dashboard actually tracks:

- Tasks and project status
- Sales pipeline
- Expenses
- Meetings and travel
- Call analysis and coaching

One screen. Updated in real time. No switching between 6 different SaaS tools.

This is what a $250/mo AI agent replaces.

## Post 9
We've deployed agents across a dozen industries now.

The pattern is always the same:

1. Founder is drowning in operational work
2. They've duct-taped together Sheets, Slack, and 4 SaaS tools
3. We replace all of it with one agent in a few weeks

Nobody misses the duct tape.

## Post 10
Your AI agent should fail gracefully.

Ours run 24/7 with failover models. If one model goes down, another picks up. No downtime. No lost tasks.

Most "AI solutions" are one API key away from a full outage.

We built ours to run like infrastructure, not a demo.

This is why we put a dedicated Mac Mini in every client's office. Their data never touches the cloud. Local AI is the future for small business.

We see this constantly. Founders don't need another SaaS tool — they need an agent that actually does the work. That's what we build at SolveWorks.

## Reply 3
The gap between "AI demo" and "AI that runs your business 24/7" is massive. Most people are still stuck on the demo side.

## Reply 4
Exactly this. We replaced a founder's entire stack of Sheets + CRM + task manager with one custom agent. $250/mo. Less than a part-time intern.

Real talk — cloud chatbots are the dial-up internet of AI. Local agents built for your actual workflows are what's next.
