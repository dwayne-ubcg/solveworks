# @solveworks_io — X Content Style Guide

## Brand Identity on X
SolveWorks is the AI agent consultancy that deploys *real* personal AI assistants for business owners. We use OpenClaw. Our clients have actual agents running 24/7 — not demos, not chatbots, not hype.

**Account:** @solveworks_io  
**Audience:** Solopreneurs, small business owners, CEOs, people genuinely curious about AI agents

---

## Voice & Tone

**WHO WE ARE:**
- Confident, not arrogant
- Builder mentality — we ship, we learn, we share
- Knowledgeable but human. Never robotic.
- Concrete over abstract. Real results, real stories.

**WHO WE ARE NOT:**
- Not a tech vendor running a LinkedIn content machine
- Not vague ("AI is transforming everything!")
- Not corporate ("We're excited to announce...")
- Not a chatbot (never sound like one)

**THE RULE:** If the post could apply to any AI company, rewrite it. We're SolveWorks. We deploy specific tools for specific problems for real business owners.

## Post Types

### 🌅 9 AM Slot — Educational/Insight
- Tips from actual deployments
- "Did you know" facts with proof
- Case study snippets (Drew, Darryl, etc.)
- Behind-the-scenes of building an AI deployment
- HOW something works (Mission Control, agent memory, etc.)

### 🕑 2 PM Slot — Engagement/Opinion
- Hot take on trending AI news
- Question to the audience
- Reaction to something that happened in AI this week
- "Most people think X, but actually Y"

### 🧵 Tuesday 10 AM — Weekly Thread
- One meaty thread, 5-10 tweets
- Topics: real client stories, lessons learned, how things actually work
- Always start with a hook (stat, surprising claim, specific story)
- End with a CTA to follow or DM

---

## Writing Rules

### Length
- **Regular posts:** Under 200 chars. Punchy beats long.
- **Threads:** Each tweet punchy, but threads can go deep (5-10 tweets)

### Hashtags
- Max 2, only when truly relevant
- Good: `#AIagents` `#solopreneur` `#buildinpublic`
- Never: generic spam like `#AI #tech #business #entrepreneur`

### Formatting
- Line breaks matter. One idea per line.
- Emojis: 1-2 max. Use when it adds tone, not decoration.
- Threads: Start with a 🧵 hook, end with CTA

### Ending Every Post
**Always end with one of:**
- A question ("How are you handling this?")
- A CTA ("Reply if you want to see how")
- A surprising reversal ("The results shocked us too")
- An invitation ("Thread below 👇")

---

## Content Topics (Draw From These)

### Client Stories
- **Drew:** "The closest thing I've found to a real chief of staff"
- **Darryl (Revaly):** Business running with AI as the connective tissue
- Real stats from deployments (hours saved, decisions handled, etc.)

### OpenClaw Use Cases
- Mission Control dashboard — what it actually shows
- How agent memory works (why it matters for business)
- How crons + heartbeats keep businesses running 24/7
- Real examples: calendar management, email triage, Slack summaries

### The 5 AI Agent Use Cases (from YouTube)
1. Chief of Staff functions (scheduling, briefings, decisions)
2. Customer-facing agents (always-on support)
3. Research & intelligence gathering
4. Operations automation (invoicing, follow-ups, tracking)
5. Knowledge base / business brain

### Solopreneur Productivity
- The leverage equation: 1 person + AI agents = output of a team
- What tasks owners hate that AI handles well
- How to get started without a developer

### Industry Takes
- React to AI news with a SolveWorks lens
- "Here's what this means for small business owners..."
- Call out BS (generic AI hype) vs. real progress

## What to NEVER Post

❌ "AI is changing everything" — too vague  
❌ "We're excited to..." — corporate cringe  
❌ Threaded posts with 15 tweets of fluff  
❌ Posts without a concrete example or insight  
❌ Anything that sounds like it was written by ChatGPT with no editing  
❌ Engagement bait without substance ("like this if you agree!")  
❌ More than 2 hashtags  

---

## Sample Posts (Reference)

**Good:**
> One of our clients asks his AI agent for a morning briefing every day. Overnight emails, calendar conflicts, pending decisions.
> 
> He calls it "better than having an EA."
> 
> What would you put in your daily briefing?

**Good:**
> Most AI tools give you a chatbot.
> 
> We give you an agent that wakes up at 6 AM, checks your calendar, reads your email, and texts you what matters.
> 
> There's a difference. 🤖

**Bad:**
> AI is revolutionizing business productivity! 🚀 Companies using AI are seeing massive gains. #AI #tech #business #entrepreneur
