  "insight": "Trevor's continued KPI resistance despite 'come hell or high water' commitment signals fundamental operational leadership gap requiring immediate CEO intervention.",
  "why": "The contrast between 7 Cellars 'flying' (10 days post-acquisition with OpenClaw AI, systems, shipping) versus Revaly 'floundering' after 15+ months demonstrates this isn't a business model problem—it's an execution leadership problem. Trevor building models instead of driving accountability while revenue sits at 95-96% of target with key accounts struggling reveals the operational excellence gap that's preventing breakthrough.",
  "action": "Schedule one-on-one with Trevor this week to establish single departmental KPI with weekly accountability tracking—no more analysis paralysis. If resistance continues, accelerate Brad working session timeline to address operational leadership structure.",
