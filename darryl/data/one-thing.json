{
  "insight": "Trevor's KPI implementation failure breaks 'come hell or high water' commitment, signaling fundamental operational crisis requiring immediate CEO intervention rather than continued coaching.",
  "why": "15-month operational decline has escalated to 'business is floundering' status while 7 Cellars achieves excellence in 10 days using same OpenClaw tools. Executive coach Heath confirmed Trevor is 'strategic thinker' not 'world-class operator' business needs. Q3 2026 fundraise success depends on demonstrating operational turnaround capability.",
  "action": "Schedule immediate one-on-one with Trevor this week to implement one KPI per department with weekly L10 accountability meetings, or begin succession planning discussions with Brad during pre-board working session.",
