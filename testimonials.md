# SolveWorks Testimonials

## Drew (Anthony M.) — Entrepreneur
> "I'm an entrepreneur and prior to engaging with SolveWorks, I was drowning in tabs, context-switching, and the feeling I wasn't efficient with my time. Within the first day, it had live lead scanners running, pulling Canadian expansion signals for Nmbr — automatically, every morning. It set up dividend research with analyst targets and price averages. It analysed my call recordings and gave me real coaching feedback. Within the first day. If you're an entrepreneur wearing multiple hats at once, this is the closest thing I've found to a real chief of staff. Highly recommend."

**Key highlights for marketing:**
- "Within the first day" (repeated twice — speed to value)
- "Real chief of staff" — positioning gold
- Concrete use cases: lead scanning, research automation, call coaching
- Target persona: multi-hat entrepreneur
