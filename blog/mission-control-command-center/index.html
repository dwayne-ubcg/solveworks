                <p>It's 7:14 AM. You're standing in your kitchen, coffee in hand, trying to get a picture of your day. You open your calendar — three back-to-back meetings, one with a prospect you barely remember. You check Slack — 47 unread messages across 8 channels. Email? Don't even look. Your CRM has a deal that's gone cold but you can't remember why. Somewhere in a Google Doc there's a competitive analysis someone ran last week. Your flight to Miami is… tomorrow? Or Thursday?</p>

                <p>This is the reality of running a business in 2026. Not a lack of tools — a <strong class="text-white">flood</strong> of them. The average CEO uses 12+ apps daily and spends nearly two hours just <em>finding information</em> before they can act on it. Every app has its own login, its own notification bell, its own version of the truth. And you — the person who's supposed to be making strategic decisions — are spending your mornings as a human router, patching together context from a dozen different sources.</p>

                <p>Something has to give. That's why we built Mission Control.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Not Another App. Your Operations Center.</h2>

                <p>Mission Control isn't a project management tool. It's not a CRM. It's not a "smart dashboard" that shows you charts you'll never look at.</p>

                <p>It's the single screen where your entire business — and your life — converges. Built as a dark, premium command center you can pull up on your phone or laptop, it surfaces what matters <em>right now</em> across every domain: business operations, sales pipeline, health, travel, competitive landscape, email, security, and the AI agents working behind the scenes on your behalf.</p>

                <p>Think of it as the cockpit for your company. A fighter pilot doesn't check 12 separate screens for altitude, speed, fuel, and threats. They have one heads-up display that synthesizes everything. You deserve the same thing.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Morning Briefings That Actually Matter</h2>

                <p>When you open Mission Control, you don't get a generic "here's what happened" summary. You get a <strong class="text-white">mission statement for the day</strong> — a curated briefing your AI agent wrote overnight after scanning your calendar, inbox, task list, CRM pipeline, and recent activity.</p>

                <p>It might read: <em>"Three meetings today — the 2pm is your highest-priority prospect ($45K deal, proposal stage). Your agent prepared a competitive comparison overnight. Two urgent emails need replies before noon. Your flight to Denver is confirmed for Thursday — hotel and itinerary are set."</em></p>

                <p>Below that, stat cards give you the instant pulse: active tasks, pipeline value, unread emails by priority, meetings today, agent activity. No clicking through menus. No context switching. You see the number, you know where you stand.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Meeting Prep That Runs Itself</h2>

                <p>You're about to walk into a call with a potential enterprise client. Normally, you'd spend 20 minutes scrambling — who is this person? What did we discuss last time? What's their company doing?</p>

                <p>With Mission Control, your meetings section shows every upcoming meeting with full AI-powered prep already done. Your agent researched the attendee's company, pulled recent news, flagged relevant deals in your CRM, and summarized the last conversation. There's even a prep input field — drop a question like "What's their current tech stack?" and the answer appears before the call starts.</p>

                <p>You walk in informed. You ask better questions. You close more deals. And you didn't spend a single minute on research.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Travel Management — Six Months Ahead, On Autopilot</h2>

                <p>Mission Control scans your calendar six months out, identifies every trip, and auto-populates a full travel section with flights, hotels, itineraries, and notes. Each trip is expandable — click into your upcoming Miami trip and see your outbound flight details, confirmation numbers, hotel check-in time, and a day-by-day itinerary your agent built based on the meetings and events already on your calendar.</p>

                <p>No more digging through email confirmations. No more "wait, which hotel did I book?" Everything's in one place, organized by date, flagged as upcoming or completed. Your agent even adds contextual notes — visa requirements, time zone differences, restaurant recommendations near your hotel.</p>

                <p>For founders who travel weekly, this alone justifies the entire system.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Your Health Data, Where You Actually See It</h2>

                <p>Here's something no business dashboard has ever done: surface your health data alongside your work data. Mission Control pulls from your Oura Ring and Apple Watch to show sleep quality, readiness scores, heart rate variability, activity levels, and recovery trends — right in the same interface where you're checking your pipeline.</p>

                <p>Why? Because a CEO running on 4 hours of sleep making decisions about a $200K deal is a liability. Your readiness score matters as much as your revenue forecast. Mission Control doesn't pretend these things are separate — because they're not.</p>

                <p>You get sleep breakdowns (deep, REM, light, awake), weekly HRV trends, step counts, and readiness scores with historical context. It's not a fitness app — it's a performance indicator for the most important asset in your business: you.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Competitive Intelligence on Autopilot</h2>

                <p>Mission Control's competitive intel section monitors your industry automatically. Your AI agents scan for competitor funding rounds, product launches, pricing changes, key hires, and market shifts — then deliver them as digestible intelligence cards with relevance scores and strategic insights.</p>

                <p>Each card doesn't just tell you <em>what</em> happened — it tells you <em>why it matters to you</em>. A competitor raised a Series B? Your agent flags how this changes the competitive landscape and suggests positioning adjustments. A new regulation is coming? You get the summary, the timeline, and the recommended action.</p>

                <p>No more manually checking competitor websites. No more missing industry moves because you were too busy running your own company to watch theirs.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Call Analysis With Sales Coaching Built In</h2>

                <p>Every sales call gets analyzed automatically. Mission Control's call analysis section shows you each call with AI-generated takeaways, next steps, and — here's the kicker — <strong class="text-white">Sandler methodology scoring</strong>.</p>

                <p>Your calls get rated on pain discovery, budget qualification, decision process, and fulfillment criteria. A visual score bar shows where you're strong and where you're leaving money on the table. It's like having a sales coach review every single call, without the $500/hour invoice.</p>

                <p>For founders who are still the primary salesperson (most of you), this is transformative. You see patterns across calls. You notice when you're skipping qualification steps. You get better at selling without thinking about getting better at selling.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Email Triage — Your Inbox, Sorted By an AI That Knows Your Business</h2>

                <p>Mission Control doesn't just show your emails. It <strong class="text-white">categorizes</strong> them: urgent, needs response, FYI, promotional. Each email gets a suggested action — "Reply with updated pricing," "Forward to ops team," "Archive — no action needed."</p>

                <p>You're not reading 87 emails anymore. You're scanning 6 urgent ones, knocking out the 12 that need responses, and letting the rest sort themselves. The AI knows which emails actually matter based on your business context — a message from your biggest client doesn't sit in the same pile as a SaaS newsletter.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Security Monitoring — Because You Can't Afford Not To</h2>

                <p>If you run any kind of digital infrastructure — websites, APIs, customer databases — Mission Control's security section gives you a real-time overview. SSL certificate status, uptime monitoring, recent security audits, vulnerability scans, and alerts — all in one place.</p>

                <p>Most founders don't think about security until something breaks. Mission Control makes it passive. A green badge means everything's fine. A yellow badge means something needs attention. You don't need to understand the technical details — you just need to know if your house is in order.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Everything Else: Tasks, CRM, Agents, Documents, Reading Lists</h2>

                <p><strong class="text-white">Tasks</strong> sync with your AI agent — items are categorized by priority (high, medium, low) and status (in progress, waiting, blocked, completed). No more lost to-dos. Your agent can add tasks from call takeaways, email actions, or meeting follow-ups automatically.</p>

                <p><strong class="text-white">CRM Pipeline</strong> gives you a visual pipeline with deal stages, values, and probabilities. See your total pipeline value, win rate, and which deals need attention — without logging into a separate CRM.</p>

                <p><strong class="text-white">AI Agents</strong> are visible right in the dashboard. See which agents are active, what they're working on, their capabilities, and their recent activity. Your research agent, social media agent, operations agent — they're all reporting into the same command center.</p>

                <p><strong class="text-white">Documents</strong> are organized and searchable. Reports, proposals, presentations — all accessible from the same interface.</p>

                <p><strong class="text-white">AI-Drafted Outreach</strong> prepares personalized emails for prospects and partners, complete with context about why you're reaching out and what you're proposing. Review, edit, send.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">One Screen. Dark. Premium. Built for Founders.</h2>

                <p>Mission Control isn't built for teams of 500. It's built for the founder who runs two companies, sits on a board, travels twice a month, and still needs to remember their kid's soccer game on Saturday.</p>

                <p>The dark interface isn't just aesthetic — it's functional. You check it at 6 AM before anyone's awake and at 11 PM before bed. It's designed to be glanceable on your phone and deep on your laptop. Every section loads instantly. Every card is actionable.</p>

                <p>No onboarding wizard. No 47-step setup. We build it, customize it to your business, connect your data sources, and hand you the keys. Your AI agents start populating it from day one.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">See It Live</h2>

                <p>We don't do screenshots and promises. We built a fully interactive demo so you can click through every section yourself — dashboard, meetings, travel, health, calls, CRM, email, security, competitive intel, and more.</p>
