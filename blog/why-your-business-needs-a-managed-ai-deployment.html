                <p>AI agents have changed the game. For the first time, businesses of any size can deploy AI agents that actually <em>do things</em> — manage your calendar, triage your inbox, pull data from your CRM, draft reports, coordinate across tools. Not chatbots that answer FAQs. Real agents that work across your business systems.</p>

                <p>If you're evaluating AI agents for your organization, you're making a smart move. The productivity gains are real and measurable.</p>

                <p>But here's what most vendors won't tell you: <strong class="text-white">the way you deploy matters as much as what you deploy.</strong> And the default path — spinning up agents yourself using the open ecosystem — comes with security risks that most businesses aren't equipped to manage.</p>

                <p>This isn't hypothetical. These are documented, published findings from security researchers in early 2026.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Open Ecosystem Has Real Vulnerabilities</h2>

                <p>The power of modern AI agents comes from their open architecture. Anyone can build skills (plugins), share agents, and connect to virtually any business tool. That openness is also its biggest security liability.</p>

                <p>Here's what researchers have found:</p>

                <div class="glass rounded-2xl p-6 my-8 space-y-4">
                    <div class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-amber-400 text-lg mt-0.5">⚠️</span>

                    <div class="flex items-start gap-3">

                        <div><strong class="text-white">341 malicious skills identified</strong> in the ClawHub marketplace, including credential harvesters and prompt injection payloads. <span class="text-gray-500">(HackerNews / ClawHub security audit)</span></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex items-start gap-3">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>These aren't theoretical attack vectors. They're documented incidents. Real agents, leaking real credentials, running real malicious code.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">DIY Deployment Is Running Unvetted Apps from the Internet</h2>

                <p>When a business deploys AI agents on its own, here's what typically happens: someone on the team spins up an agent, installs a few skills from the marketplace to connect their tools, and starts testing. It works. It's exciting. They add more skills, connect more systems, give it broader permissions.</p>

                <p>Nobody audits the skill source code. Nobody reviews the OAuth scopes. Nobody checks whether the agent endpoint is publicly accessible. Nobody monitors what data flows where.</p>

                <p>This is the equivalent of downloading random apps from the internet and giving them admin access to your business systems. You wouldn't do that with your laptop. <strong class="text-white">You shouldn't do it with an AI agent that has access to your email, calendar, CRM, and financial tools.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The "One Compromised Agent" Problem</h2>

                <p>Here's the risk most people don't think about: blast radius.</p>

                <p>A compromised AI agent isn't like a compromised user account. A user has limited context — they know what they know. An AI agent connected to your business tools has <em>all</em> the context. It can read every email. It can see every calendar invite. It can access every document it's been connected to. It can see customer data, financial records, internal communications.</p>

                <p>If a malicious skill harvests that agent's credentials, the attacker doesn't just get access to one thing. They get access to <strong class="text-white">everything that agent touches.</strong> And if your agents share a runtime environment — which is the default in most DIY setups — one compromised agent can pivot to others.</p>

                <p>Executive-level AI assistants need executive-level security. When the agent has access to the CEO's inbox and calendar, the blast radius of a compromise is the entire organization's strategic communications.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">What a Managed Deployment Does Differently</h2>

                <p>A managed deployment isn't just "someone else hosts it." It's a fundamentally different security posture. Think of it as the difference between downloading random apps and a locked-down enterprise MDM deployment.</p>

                <p>Here's what that looks like in practice:</p>

                <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
                    <div class="flex items-start gap-4">

                    <div class="flex items-start gap-4">

                </div>

                <p>The key insight: <strong class="text-white">these controls are layered.</strong> Even if one fails, the others contain the impact. A compromised skill can't reach the network. A network breach can't access credentials. A credential leak can't perform actions without human approval. Defense in depth isn't a buzzword — it's the architecture.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">We've Seen This Play Out in Practice</h2>

                <p>In a recent client engagement, the company's security team had read the Bitdefender report and The Verge coverage. They came to us with a clear message: <em>"We want AI agents for our leadership team, but we're not comfortable with the security posture of the open platform."</em></p>

                <p>They were right to be cautious. And they were right that the answer isn't "don't use AI agents" — it's "deploy them properly."</p>

                <p>We designed a controlled pilot: a small number of executive assistants, read-only integrations, human approval on every outbound action, sandboxed runtimes, and weekly security reviews with their IT team. Full visibility. Full control. A kill switch that works in seconds, not hours.</p>

                <p>The result? The security team signed off. The executives got AI assistants that save them hours every week. And the company has a clear, controlled expansion path for broader rollout — on their timeline, at their comfort level.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>AI agents represent a genuine leap forward for business productivity. The technology works. The use cases are real. The ROI is measurable.</p>

                <p>But deploying them without enterprise security controls is like building a house without locks. The vulnerabilities in the open ecosystem aren't bugs that will get patched next quarter — they're structural features of an open platform that prioritizes accessibility over security.</p>

                <p>Smart companies don't avoid AI agents. They deploy them with the same rigor they'd apply to any other enterprise system that touches sensitive data. That means managed deployment, not DIY.</p>

                <p><strong class="text-white">The question isn't whether to deploy AI agents. It's whether you're deploying them in a way that won't keep your security team up at night.</strong></p>
