# Gold Standard Template

**Current:** `mike-dades-proposal.html` (Mike Dades, Staffing Firm — Feb 26, 2026)

## Rule
The most recently built proposal is always the gold standard. Every time a new proposal is completed, update this file to point to it.

## Update this file after every new proposal:
1. Change the filename above
2. Update the client name and date
