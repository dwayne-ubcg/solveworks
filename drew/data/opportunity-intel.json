{"content": "# Opportunity Intel \u2014 Updated 2026-02-24 (LinkedIn Monitoring 9 AM)\n\n---\n\n## Feb 24, 2026 \u2014 Daily Scan\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CHARLIE | Lawmatics Launches QualifyAI \u2014 Direct Competitor to Charlie in Law Firm Intake (NEW \u2014 Feb 24)\nLawmatics (a leading CRM for law firms) just launched **QualifyAI** out of beta \u2014 an AI agent that qualifies inbound leads against firm-defined criteria. G2 ranked them #11 Best Legal Software 2026. CEO quote: \"If you're slow to respond or don't realize a lead isn't a fit until you're preparing a contract, you're going to lose.\" Sound familiar? This is Charlie's lane \u2014 speed-to-contact, intake qualification, lead conversion. The difference: Lawmatics is post-inquiry qualification (score/rank leads already in the CRM). Charlie is real-time dialogue and booking. Charlie needs to sharpen its PI law firm messaging *against* this \u2014 \"We don't just qualify, we convert. First responder, not just a scorer.\"\n- Action: Update Charlie PI pitch to explicitly differentiate from Lawmatics QualifyAI \u2014 Charlie is proactive AI dialogue + instant booking vs. passive scoring.\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CHARLIE | EvenUp Expands Into Voice/SMS Agents for PI Firms (NEW \u2014 Feb 24)\nEvenUp (demand letter automation for PI) is now promoting AI voice and SMS agents to reduce costs and speed settlements. EvenUp already has PI firms as clients \u2014 this is a land-and-expand into intake/comms territory. Not a direct Charlie competitor today, but a signal that PI firms are hungry for AI across the whole client journey. EvenUp has existing relationships at firms Charlie is targeting.\n- Action: If pitching a firm that uses EvenUp, use it as a credibility bridge \u2014 \"You're already using AI for demand letters, Charlie closes the intake gap.\"\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 NMBR | Dayforce Wins $350M Federal Government Contract (10-Year)\nDayforce (Ceridian) just locked up a $350.6M deal to replace the Phoenix pay system for the federal government. 10-year term with extension option. They're going full enterprise-government. This is a positioning gift for Nmbr: the giants are chasing big government, leaving vertical SaaS/mid-market wide open.\n- Suggested action: Use this in outbound \u2014 \"Dayforce is replacing Phoenix. They're not building for your SaaS platform. We are.\"\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 CHARLIE | PI Law AI Sector Lighting Up \u2014 3 New Platforms This Week\nParambil (agentic AI platform for PI, Feb 18), Supio (settlement optimization AI, Feb 19), ProPlaintiff (AI-native PI platform, AZ Inno finalist) all launched/announced this week. PI law firms are in active buying mode for AI right now. None of these are speed-to-contact / intake conversion tools \u2014 that's Charlie's exact lane.\n- Suggested action: Push Charlie outreach to PI firms hard this week \u2014 they're primed to buy AI tools right now.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe1 NMBR | Wagepoint Confirms \"First of Several\" Product Launches in 2026\nWagepoint VP of Product (Jenna Poste) publicly stated Feb 19: \"These are the first of several product launches planned this year as we continue building a platform that brings payroll, time, and people together in one place.\" They're accelerating. But their play is direct-to-SMB. Nmbr's embedded/API positioning is structurally different \u2014 this isn't a head-on fight, but SaaS companies evaluating Wagepoint as a potential embedded option need to be intercepted now.\n- Suggested action: Flag to Nmbr team \u2014 may want to accelerate any case studies or partner content before Wagepoint gets there first in the vertical SaaS narrative.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe1 NETWORKING | SaaS North 2026 \u2014 Ottawa, November\nCanada's largest SaaS conference just confirmed November 2026 in Ottawa. Last year's event drew 3,000+ SaaS founders, operators, and investors. This is Nmbr's ICP in a single room.\n- Suggested action: Put SaaS North on the calendar now. Consider applying for a speaking slot (embedded payroll for vertical SaaS = relevant topic). Registration opens soon.\n\n---\n\n# Opportunity Intel \u2014 Updated 2026-02-23\n\n## Last Updated\nFeb 23, 2026 \u2014 9:00 AM Atlantic\n\n---\n\n## Charlie \u2014 Active Hiring Lead (Feb 23, 2026)\n- **Pause Breathwork** \u2014 High-ticket coaching/transformation company actively posting for a \"High-Ticket Appointment Setter - Coaching & Transformation Programs\" on DynamiteJobs ($40-45k/yr).

Full-suite competitor entering properly. Mainly targeting SMBs who want all-in-one (Zoho One).
