audio would need OpenAI Whisper API (not yet installed)\n- Updated Freedom's TOOLS.md with Mission Control dashboard instructions\n- Drew's dashboard at solveworks.io/drew/ (password: freedommc7c)\n\n## Feature Ideas (Dwayne, Feb 22)\n- **Auto-populate Travel from Calendar**: Scan 6 months ahead, detect travel-related events (flights, hotels, OOO, city names, conferences), auto-create trip entries in travel.json\n- **Meeting Prep in Dashboard**: Calendar syncs \u2192 meetings appear \u2192 user adds prep request comment \u2192 agent researches \u2192 findings attached to meeting card before the call\n- Auto-suggest prep based on attendee names (known contacts trigger relevant data pulls)\n- Demo dashboard needs full rebuild as showcase for prospects (all sections, rich fake data, no password, SolveWorks CTAs)\n\n## CRITICAL FAILURE: Darryl's Morning Briefing Never Fired (Feb 22)\n- Gateway had \"pairing required\" \u2014 scope was operator.read only, not full agent scopes\n- Crons never ran \u2014 morning briefing, competitive intel, board prep ALL silent since install\n- Root cause: CRON JOBS WRITTEN IN WRONG JSON FORMAT. Used `cron`/`tz` at top level instead of `schedule: {kind: \"cron\", expr: \"...\", tz: \"...\"}`. Gateway cron subsystem crashed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'kind')`\n- NOT a pairing issue \u2014 pairing only affects CLI-to-gateway RPC, not cron/Telegram delivery\n- FIXED REMOTELY at 10:41 AM \u2014 rewrote jobs.json to correct schema, restarted gateways\n- Both Darryl (9 jobs) and Drew (14 jobs) now armed and will fire on schedule\n- **This should have been caught during install verification**\n- Created: ~/clawd/solveworks-site/docs/post-install-verification.md (6-point mandatory checklist)\n- Sent Darryl message to run `openclaw pair` + republish calendar\n- **LESSON: NEVER leave a client install without manually triggering the first briefing and confirming delivery**\n\n## Content: Mission Control Blog Post\n- Blog post for solveworks.io about the value of Mission Control for business owners\n- Angle: How an AI-powered command center helps you run your life AND business\n- Cover: morning briefings, meeting prep, travel management, health tracking, competitive intel, security, task management, call analysis, CRM pipeline\n- Target audience: busy founders/CEOs who are juggling multiple businesses\n- Link to the live demo (solveworks.io/demo/)\n- Spawn Reece or content sub-agent after demo dashboard is complete\n\n## KEY DECISION: Dashboards Must Be Fully Interactive (~1:30 PM)\n- Dwayne explicitly wants FULL FUNCTIONALITY in every dashboard section \u2014 not just info display\n- Every section = actions, not just data:\n  - **Travel**: Request restaurant research, book reservations, add trips, add flights/hotels\n  - **Tasks**: Create, edit, reprioritize, mark complete, assign\n  - **Meetings**: Add prep requests, attach notes, RSVP, reschedule\n  - **Documents**: Upload, tag, share, search\n  - **Activity Feed**: Filter, dismiss, pin, act on items\n  - **Intel**: Save, dismiss, request deeper research, share with team\n  - **Health**: Log metrics, set goals, view trends\n  - **Security**: Run audits, dismiss alerts, drill into details\n  - **Calls**: Add notes, tag follow-ups, request coaching analysis\n  - **CRM**: Move deals through stages, add deals, log interactions\n- A sub-agent already built `shared/interactivity.js` with localStorage-based interactions for all sections\n- Next: wire to actual agent API so actions trigger real work (not just localStorage)\n- **This is a CORE PRINCIPLE for all SolveWorks dashboards going forward**\n\n## Darryl Calendar Discovery (~1:25 PM)\n- Darryl's calendar works via Brit's `calendar-reader` skill on Kusanagi (NOT the ICS feed)\n- Command: `ssh Kusanagi@100.83.184.91 \"bash ~/clawd/skills/calendar-reader/scripts/query_calendar.sh range ...\"`\n- Pulled 764 events over 6 months\n- Found and pushed 6 trips to darryl/data/travel.json:\n  1. Las Vegas (Mar 16-18) \u2014 MRC Vegas, Aria Hotel (9CBMG6TO), full flights\n  2. Yellowknife (Mar 5) \u2014 YPO Chapter Retreat\n  3. Vancouver (Apr 9) \u2014 YPO Strategic Planning\n  4. Chicago (Apr 26) \u2014 YPO GLC\n  5. Toronto (May 26) \u2014 YPO AI & Automation Summit\n  6. Vancouver (Jun 5) \u2014 YPO Family Event\n- Also seeded Darryl's dashboard: tasks (9), activity feed (6), intel (3), documents (6), 42 meetings\n- Travel research sub-agent spawned to add real restaurant/activity data to Whistler + Vegas trips\n- Context was lost to compaction TWICE during this work \u2014 wrote memory immediately this time\n\n## Dashboard Bug Fix Sprint (~1:30-2:15 PM)\n- Darryl's dashboard had cascading failures \u2014 one JS error killed all sections after it\n- Root causes found and fixed:\n  1. **Documents data key mismatch**: Data has `{documents:[...]}` but code expected `{folders:[...]}`  \u2014 crash in renderDocs killed everything after it\n  2. **Intel data key mismatch**: Data has `{items:[...]}` but code expected `{opportunities:[...]}` \u2014 also field names `detail`/`action` vs `content`/`description`\n  3. **No try-catch in init()**: One section error killed ALL subsequent sections \u2014 now every section wrapped individually\n  4. **Meetings badge**: Was counting today-only (0 on weekend) \u2014 now counts all upcoming\n  5. **iPad/mobile scroll broken**: `body{height:100vh;overflow:hidden;display:flex}` = scroll trap on touch devices\n  6. **Mobile breakpoint too low**: Was 768px, iPad is 1024px \u2014 bumped breakpoint, Chrome on iPad now shows nav\n- Fix: `pointer:coarse` media query for touch devices, `min-height:0`, `-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch`\n- All fixes pushed, Darryl's dashboard fully working on iPad Safari + Chrome\n- **MUST apply same fixes to Dwayne's, Drew's, and demo dashboards**\n\n## Drew's Calendar Connected (~2:30 PM)\n- Drew paired his OpenClaw CLI successfully (`openclaw pairing`)\n- Installed gcalcli on his machine but it needed OAuth creds \u2014 too complex\n- Switched to ICS feed approach (same as we tried with Darryl)\n- **Two ICS feeds working:**\n  1. Nmbr: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/drew%40nmbr.co/private-5b5c6dde330e1ee20dc08ee9bb9a5d91/basic.ics` (54 events, main calendar)\n  2.

{"date":"2026-02-21","content":"# 2026-02-21 \u2014 Saturday\n\n## Early Morning (~5-6 AM)\n- **Drew (Anthony M.) agent broke** \u2014 his agent changed its own model config to `openai/claude-sonnet-4` (invalid). Walked Dwayne through fix: correct to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, restart gateway.\n- **Drew burning too many API credits** \u2014 he's on pay-per-token API while Dwayne is on Max plan (flat rate via setup-token). Gave Dwayne instructions to switch Drew to setup-token auth off a Max subscription instead.\n- **Tailscale not set up on Drew's machine** \u2014 still needs to be done. No remote access to his Mac Mini currently. This is a SolveWorks deployment risk.\n- **Dwayne trying to set up SolveWorks Google Workspace email access** (dwayne@solveworks.io) \u2014 needed App Passwords, which requires 2FA + Workspace admin enabling it. Still in progress.\n\n## Drew Testimonial (~7 AM)\n- Drew sent real testimonial for SolveWorks site and one-pager\n- Key quote: \"closest thing I've found to a real chief of staff\"\n- Saved to ~/clawd/solveworks-site/testimonials.md\n- Spawned sub-agent to add to index.html and ypo-one-pager.html\n- Still waiting on Darryl's testimonial\n\n## Drew Setup Token Auth (~8-9 AM)\n- Walked Drew through switching from API billing to Max plan setup-token auth\n- He successfully ran `openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic`\n- But his agent broke AGAIN \u2014 changed model back to `openai/claude-sonnet-4`\n- Gave instructions to add \"never edit your own config\" rules to his AGENTS.md\n\n## Tailscale for Drew (~9-10 AM)\n- Attempting to get Tailscale on Drew's machine for remote access\n- Had conflicts between CLI install and app \u2014 told him to kill tailscaled process\n- App keeps crashing, likely old CLI process blocking it\n- Still in progress\n- Dwayne's Tailscale account: dwayne@urbanbutter.com\n- Generated auth key for Drew to join Dwayne's Tailnet\n\n## Drew \u2014 Full Remote Access Established (~11 AM)\n- **Tailscale connected:** `freedombots-macbook-pro` at `100.124.57.91` on Dwayne's Tailnet (dwayne@urbanbutter.com)\n- **SSH working:** `ssh freedombot@100.124.57.91`\n- SSH key generated on Mac Mini and added to Drew's authorized_keys\n- **Remote Login** enabled in System Settings on Drew's Mac\n\n## Drew \u2014 Auth & Model Fixed Remotely (~11-12 PM)\n- Fixed model from `openai/claude-sonnet-4` \u2192 `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`\n- Set up Max subscription setup-token auth (replaced API key billing)\n- Removed old API key from auth-profiles.json\n- Agent kept reverting model config \u2014 added guardrails to both SOUL.md and AGENTS.md\n- Tried chmod 444 on config but broke gateway \u2014 reverted to 644\n- Gateway service got uninstalled during troubleshooting \u2014 reinstalled with `openclaw gateway install`\n- **Drew's agent token:** `sk-ant-oat01-hpw2CUQ...o7VKHwAA`\n\n## Drew \u2014 Testimonial for SolveWorks\n- Real testimonial received, saved to ~/clawd/solveworks-site/testimonials.md\n- Key quote: \"closest thing I've found to a real chief of staff\"\n- Sub-agent spawned to add to site index.html and ypo-one-pager.html\n- Still waiting on Darryl's testimonial\n\n## Drew \u2014 Dashboard Prompt (~2 PM)\n- Gave Dwayne a prompt for Drew's agent to build a mission control dashboard\n- Sections: My Tasks, Agent Tasks, Documents, Call Recordings\n- Local web app at ~/clawd/dashboard/\n\n## SolveWorks Standard: Dual-Provider Failover (CONFIRMED)\n- Every client deployment gets: Primary (Anthropic Max setup-token) + Fallback (Google Gemini Flash, free tier)\n- SolveWorks manages the Gemini fallback key (or per-client keys)\n- Selling point: \"Your agent never goes down \u2014 dual-provider failover built in\"\n- This solved Drew's rate-limit outage immediately\n- Add to all proposals, one-pager, and deployment playbook\n\n## Darryl Install (~6:30-7:30 PM)\n- **Machine:** darryls-mac-mini, Tailscale IP `100.83.184.91`, user `Kusanagi`\n- **Telegram bot:** @DarrylAssistant_bot (token: 8443155276:...)\n- **Auth:** Claude Max setup-token + Gemini Flash fallback (standard build)\n- **Passwordless sudo enabled** (needed for remote installs)\n- Installed: Homebrew, Node, OpenClaw, Claude CLI \u2014 all via SSH\n- Loaded: All 17 custom skills, 7 Cellars SOPs/brand/meetings, Revaly master prompt (full CEO context)\n- **Cron jobs:** 6 AM PT morning briefing, 7 AM PT weekday competitive intel, 9 AM PT Friday board prep\n- **Calendar:** Outlook 365 ICS feed wired into morning briefing\n- **Security:** SOUL.md + AGENTS.md guardrails \u2014 no installs without permission, no config changes\n- Darryl's Telegram user ID: 495065127\n- Darryl said \"Great install!!\" \u2014 potential testimonial incoming\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- SolveWorks client deployments need a standard onboarding checklist: Tailscale, setup-token auth (not API key), model config locked down so agents can't self-modify provider settings\n- Drew's agent self-modifying config is a recurring problem \u2014 guardrails added to AGENTS.md + SOUL.md as standard for all client deploys\n- Can't chmod config read-only \u2014 breaks gateway. Guardrails in system prompt are the only option for now\n- `claude setup-token` needs a real TTY \u2014 can't run via SSH, must be done physically at the machine\n\n## Dashboard & Tools Sprint (Feb 21)\n\n### Completed\n1. **Financials section** added to 7 Cellars dashboard \u2014 revenue-only until landed costs entered\n   - Sync pulls from Cin7 Sale API (Order + Quote stage)\n   - COGS hardcoded off until Dwayne confirms real landed costs in Cin7\n   - costsReliable flag controls visibility of margins/profit/legacy tracker\n\n2. **Revenue sync fixed** \u2014 was missing ESTIMATED (Quote-stage) sales, now captures all ($9,654.70 across 23 orders)\n\n3. **Wholesale CRM** \u2014 Customers section added, 16 accounts with status tags (Active/At Risk/New), revenue per account\n\n4. **Quote Generator** \u2014 on dashboard + standalone creator form at solveworks.io/7cellars/create-quote.html\n   - Editable per-line prices, discount %, base tier selection\n   - Publishes branded quote pages to 7cellars.ky via Shopify API\n   - API server running on Mac Mini port 3847\n   - Password: quotes7c\n\n5. **Convert to Order** flow \u2014 pending quotes can be converted to Cin7 sales\n\n6. **Meeting \u2192 Action Items pipeline** \u2014 built, dry run verified, testing with Monday's partner call\n   - Script at ~/clawd/7cellars/scripts/meeting-actions.sh\n   - Dual output: dashboard kanban + Trello\n\n### Sent to Tallyn\n- Instructions to move 12 ESTIMATED sales to ORDERED status in Cin7\n\n### Pending\n- Tallyn entering remaining sales + landed costs (this week/weekend)\n- Monday partner call \u2014 test meeting action items pipeline\n- Roberto/Tallyn to start using quote creator\n- Quote API server needs to be persistent (pm2 or systemd)\n\n### Key Decisions\n- No sample/fake data on dashboard \u2014 zero state until real data\n- COGS hidden until Dwayne confirms landed costs are real\n- Quote pages live on 7cellars.ky (customer-facing), creator form on solveworks.io (internal)\n- Tallyn will be primary quote creator, not Roberto\n- Dashboard may replace Trello \u2014 testing with action items first\n\n## Session 2 \u2014 Continued Build-out (afternoon)\n\n### Sales Tab Fix\n- Sales tab was showing $2,730 instead of $9,654 for wholesale\n- Root cause: cin7-orders.json had no `Total` field (SaleList API doesn't return it)\n- Fix: sync.sh now enriches cin7-orders.json with totals + line items from Sale detail API\n- Also fixed Sales tab JS to read `Total` directly instead of `InvoiceAmount`\n\n### Tallyn Instructions Sent\n- Messaged Tallyn group (-5036963456) with instructions to move 12 ESTIMATED sales to ORDERED status\n- Listed all 12 order numbers that need converting (SO-00047 through SO-00061)\n\n### COGS Issue\n- Dashboard was showing COGS from stale AverageCost values in Cin7 \u2014 NOT real landed costs\n- Dwayne called this out \u2014 COGS should not show until real landed costs entered\n- Fixed: `costsReliable = False` hardcoded in sync.sh (TODO: flip when Dwayne confirms)\n- Dwayne explained: AverageCost currently = retail price, wholesale sales < retail = negative margin (garbage)\n\n### Quote Creator Built\n- API server running on Mac Mini port 3847 (quote-api.js)\n- Form at solveworks.io/7cellars/create-quote.html (password: quotes7c)\n- Creates Shopify pages at 7cellars.ky/pages/quote-xxx via Admin API\n- Added editable per-line prices + discount % field (Roberto adjusts prices per customer)\n- Test quote live at: 7cellars.ky/pages/quote-q-2026-02-21-001\n- Tallyn will be primary user, not Roberto (Roberto unlikely to use tools)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Quote API server needs pm2/systemd for persistence\n\n### Convert to Order Flow\n- Pending quotes can be marked for Cin7 conversion\n- process-quotes.sh script created to submit to Cin7 Sale API\n- Integrated into sync.sh pipeline\n\n### B2B Portal Direction\n- Dwayne wants customer-facing quotes on 7cellars.ky domain (not solveworks.io)\n- Future: customer self-serve accept \u2192 auto Cin7 order\n- DNS: 7cellars.ky on GoDaddy nameservers, Shopify CDN via Cloudflare\n- No separate Cloudflare account \u2014 Shopify's built-in CF\n\n### Git Cleanup\n- Added .gitignore for proposals/node_modules/ (massive puppeteer deps were getting staged)\n\n### Dwayne Feedback\n- Called me out for forgetting I had Shopify API access moments after using it \u2014 valid criticism\n- \"Your not seeing my question\" \u2014 I was answering tangentially instead of directly. Need to address the exact question asked.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Monday partner call \u2192 test meeting action items pipeline\n- Tallyn entering remaining sales + landed costs this weekend\n- When landed costs confirmed: flip costsReliable to True in sync.sh\n- Make quote API server persistent (pm2)\n"}

Dwayne flagged this specifically.\n\n## LESSON: Proposal Projections Must Be Realistic\n- Revaly proposal had savings projections HIGHER than their actual expenses \u2014 killed credibility\n- Darryl's feedback: \"lost credibility then built it\" because of inaccurate numbers\n- **Rules going forward:**\n  1. NEVER fabricate or estimate savings without real data from a discovery call\n  2. If no discovery call data, use conservative ranges or say \"to be determined after discovery\"\n  3. Better to underestimate than overestimate \u2014 credibility > impressive numbers\n  4. Always have a discovery call before final proposal\n  5. Don't hallucinate revenue/expense/savings figures\n- This applies to ALL proposals, not just Revaly\n\n## Revaly Discovery Call \u2014 Next Week\n- Brody doing discovery call with one of the Revaly owners\n- Building a personal agent (like Drew's setup)\n- Use the new discovery template for this call\n- Remember: previous Revaly proposal had inflated numbers \u2014 this time we get REAL data from the call\n- Darryl owns Revaly \u2014 every interaction is a SolveWorks demo\n\n## SolveWorks Pricing \u2014 CONFIRMED\n- **Setup:** $1,500 (one-time)\n- **Monthly:** $250/month (maintenance \u2014 new skills, updates, support)\n- Source: Dwayne's friend pitched to YPO group, multiple interested, this pricing suggested\n- YPO members run businesses $5M+ revenue\n- Multiple booking calls coming in from this\n\n## SolveWorks Pricing \u2014 UPDATED\n- **Setup:** $1,500 (one-time)\n- **Option A:** $250/month \u2014 client pays their own Anthropic API costs\n- **Option B:** $450/month \u2014 fully managed, SolveWorks covers AI/API costs\n- Both include: maintenance, new skills, updates, priority support\n\n## Case Studies \u2014 Real Clients\n- Replace old fictional case studies with real ones\n- **Dwayne S.** \u2014 3 businesses (urbanbutter, 7 Cellars, SolveWorks) with one agent\n- **Anthony M.** (Drew) \u2014 Senior exec, personal agent deployment\n- Wait a few days then ask Anthony for a quote\n- Follow up: ~Feb 22-23 for Anthony's quote\n\n## SolveWorks \u2014 Pricing in USD\n- All pricing is USD standard\n- Exceptions case by case at Dwayne's discretion\n\n## SolveWorks Deployment Model \u2014 CONFIRMED\n- Mac Mini fleet model: buy, build here, ship to client, plug and play\n- $1,500 setup (covers Mini ~$600 + build time)\n- $250/month \u2014 client pays own Anthropic API key\n- $450/month \u2014 fully managed, SolveWorks covers API costs\n- All pricing in USD\n- Kill switch via Tailscale + SSH + OpenClaw config control\n- Every Mini ships with: Tailscale, SSH keys, auto-start, SolveWorks-controlled config\n- Client just plugs in ethernet + power\n- Remote management via Tailscale for updates, skills, troubleshooting\n\n## Proposals Sent \u2014 Feb 19\n- **McAdoo's (Tyler)** \u2014 tylert@mcadoos.ca \u2014 construction/landscaping\n- **Rylem (Mike)** \u2014 miked@rylem.com \u2014 Seattle staffing agency  \n- **HitLights (Joe)** \u2014 jfreeman@hitlights.com \u2014 LED lighting products, 5K+ installers\n- All pre-call proposals, framed as initial assessments\n- All came from YPO network via Darryl's friend\n- Discovery calls booked with Brody\n"}
